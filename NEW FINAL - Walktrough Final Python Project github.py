Since I unsuccesfully used git in my previous submission I will re write my 
project such that the changes are saved in github.

Previously I used multiple files to track my changes. Each version was a 
bettered version of the previous one. Usually I sat down to code for a couple 
of hours and each time I did that I created a new version to make sure 
that if I made the wrong changes I could look back at my initial work. 
Exactly what github would've done for me automatically. 

To get a better hang of git functions I will use this file to track my progress
As my code was good and I am happy with it, I will to re-do what I did
before using the right tracking methods. This way I can show that I understood 
the assigment and can work with github.

In addition, I will add testing, which I did not really do previously.

I will keep my old version and work in the folder "Project Citation" so 
you can see my progress.
